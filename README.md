# Homework-code-refactor
## Description 
In this challenge, I refactored the code with the 'scout rule' in mind. I started with renaming the title to make it more interesting. To make the code more readable and reflect certain blocks of code more appropriately I renamed many of the divs as well. I added alts to all of the images that needed it.

The stylesheet had unecessary classes so I condensed some (specifically in the benefits section) to make it more compact without affecting the final code. 

Notes are added throughout the html and stylesheet to reflect certain changes.
